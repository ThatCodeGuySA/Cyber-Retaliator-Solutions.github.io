The students are introduced to the operating system by logging in and out of the system and carrying out a few basic operations. The hierarchical tree structure is explained in detail, as well as functions that can be carried out on files and directories. The concept of a shell is introduced and the operations that are supported through it. The one editor that is covered is <strong>vi</strong>, as it is available on most UNIX platforms. The concept of users owning jobs and processes is introduced, including the environment in which processes execute. Finally, to pull together all the ideas from the previous units, a few useful tools are introduced which help users customize their environments and write very simple shell scripts.</p><p>This course provides content and hands on labs in self paced virtual class (SPVC) environment.</p><p>Upon meeting course and badge completion criteria, students may receive an IBM issued badge: Power AIX User Essentials badge</p>",

We will discuss security control via system values, user and group profiles, authorization lists, and adopted authority. This course will help you develop additional skills in the areas of work management and how to create a basic CL program. In the area of CL programming, we discuss concepts of programming, then how to create a basic CL program using the traditional application development tools PDM and SEU. Then, you will learn how to use the GUI tools in RDP (RSE and LPEX). You will also learn the steps to create a menu using SDA. You will learn some tips that you can use to help improve your IBM i operations.

        "OVERVIEW": "<p>Organizations are compelled to find effective and cost-efficient data security solutions.</p><p>Encryption is one of the technologies that enables organizations to reduce the cost, impact and even likelihood of a breach. Encrypting data can help companies meet the stringent mandates of the GDPR, HIPAA and other mandates.</p><p>IBM z15 has been designed for pervasive encryption, enabling organizations to encrypt 100% of an organization’s IBM Z critical business data in-flight and at-rest, with no application changes and no impact to SLAs. Encrypting only the data required to meet compliance mandates should be considered a minimum threshold, not a best practice. IBM z15 makes pervasive encryption the new standard in data protection and the foundation of a larger data security and protection strategy.</p><p>z/OS is designed to provide new policy-based encryption options that take full advantage of the improvements in the z15 platform. These new capabilities include:</p><p>Data set encryption, which is one aspect of pervasive encryption, provides enhanced data protection for many z/OS data sets gives users the ability to encrypt data without needing to make changes to applications to embed encryption APIs within applications.</p><p>New z/OS policy controls which make it possible to use pervasive encryption to protect user data and simplify the task of compliance for many z/OS data sets, zFS file systems, and Coupling Facility structures.</p><p>Pervasive encryption for IBM Z® is a consumable approach to enable extensive encryption of data in-flight and at-rest to substantially simplify encryption and reduce costs associated with protecting data.</p><p>In this course you will learn how to implement Pervasive Encryption in your z/OS installation. The course explores in detail, the various technologies that are involved in z System and z/OS Cryptographic Services, ICSF, RACF and DFSMS access method Services.</p><p>In the hands-on exercises, you begin with the setup of your hardware crypto environment (CCA crypto express and CPACF), then you will load and activate your AES master keys, setup ICSF and its Key datasets (CKDS PKDS TKDS), then define your data encryption keys, activate your data set encryption policy, and encrypt your data sets and zFS filesystems.</p><p>These exercises reinforce the concepts and technologies being covered in the lectures.</p>",

        "OVERVIEW": "<p>The Event Manager component of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps is a carrier-class service assurance system. It collects and consolidates events and alarms from a wide variety of IT environments in real time. These include servers, mainframes, Windows systems, applications, circuit switches, voice switches, IP routers, SNMP devices, network management applications, existing management systems and frameworks, among many others. </p><p>IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager also adds intelligence to your events, allowing you to cast a wide net to ingest relevant data from any source, process it in an intelligent, automated way, analyze the data, see which applications or parts of the infrastructure are impacted, share it and even suggest guided steps to mitigate or resolve issues automatically.</p><p>One key benefit of Event Manager's machine learning features is a reduction in the number of events. By detecting, correlating, grouping, and suppressing the \"noise\" that IT systems generate, your operators can focus their attention on key events that represent actual problems. </p><p>This 2-day course teaches you how to configure IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager for productive use. Through hands-on lab activities, you learn how to configure a new installation of Event Manager to:</p><ul><li>Connect to event sources and enrich incoming events</li><li>Apply machine learning to find relationships among events</li><li>Add topology data to identify groups of connected resources and calculate root cause</li><li>Create automated fixes for known problems and match them to incoming problem events </li></ul><p>You also get hands-on practice with other common configuration tasks, such as user management and database customization. This course focuses on IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager running on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.</p>",

You are introduced to the communication between queue managers and an application and a queue manager.</p><p>MQ has many features, functions, and options. In this introduction to solution architects, a few of these are discussed. Among the select key features architects are introduced to include distributed queuing, handling undeliverable messages, how publishing and subscriptions work in MQ, and development options for creating custom application that connect to IBM MQ.</p><p>Through hands-on exercises, you become familiar with IBM MQ. You learn to install IBM MQ, create a queue manager and queue, and test messaging. You are introduced to the IBM MQ administration tools to create and manage queue managers, queues, and work with messages. You learn to work with MQ script commands and command files.</p><p>This course is a subset of the 5-day course: IBM MQ V9.1 System Administration (ZM156).

        "OVERVIEW": "<p>The Event Manager component of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps is a carrier-class service assurance system. It collects and consolidates events and alarms from a wide variety of IT environments in real time. These include servers, mainframes, Windows systems, applications, circuit switches, voice switches, IP routers, SNMP devices, network management applications, existing management systems and frameworks, among many others.&nbsp;</p><p>IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager also adds intelligence to your events, allowing you to cast a wide net to ingest relevant data from any source, process it in an intelligent, automated way, analyze the data, see which applications or parts of the infrastructure are impacted, share it and even suggest guided steps to mitigate or resolve issues automatically.</p><p>One key benefit of Event Manager's machine learning features is a reduction in the number of events. By detecting, correlating, grouping, and suppressing the \"noise\" that IT systems generate, your operators can focus their attention on key events that represent actual problems.&nbsp;</p><p>This 2-day course teaches you how to configure IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager for productive use. Through hands-on lab activities, you learn how to configure a new installation of Event Manager to:</p><ul><li>Connect to event sources and enrich incoming events</li><li>Apply machine learning to find relationships among events</li><li>Add topology data to identify groups of connected resources and calculate root cause</li><li>Create automated fixes for known problems and match them to incoming problem events&nbsp;</li></ul><p>You also get hands-on practice with other common configuration tasks, such as user management and database customization.
